# z_machine
A collection of machine-learning tools

These tools are still in the early testing phase; do not expect them to work.

The easiest way to build them is using Qt Creator or qmake to process the .pro file into a makefile.

The following libraries are addtionally necessary:
* Armadillo (for simple matrix operations)
* Blas and Lapack (for advanced matrix operations in conjunction with Armadillo)
